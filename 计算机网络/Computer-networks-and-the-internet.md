# chapter 1 Computer networks and the internet

## what is internet

1. What is the internet: (1)The basic hardware and software components that make up the internet. (2)A networking infrastructure that provides service to the distributed applications.
2. The basic components are: (1)communication links. (2)packat switches: routers and link-layer switches. Link layer switches are typically used in access networks, while routers are typically used in the network core. (3)ISPs: residential ISPs、corporate ISPs、university ISPs、cellular data ISPs and so on.
3. The IETF documents are called requests for comments(RFCs). RFCs are tend to be quite technical and detailed.
4. The applications are said to be distributed since they involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other.
5. End systems attach to internet via socket interface, whick is a set of rules that the sending program must follow so that the internet can diliver data to the destination program.
6. In human protocol, there are specific messages we send, and specific actions we take in response to the recieved messages or other events. A network protocol defines the format and order of the messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the trasmission or receipt of a message or other events.

## the network edge

1. End systems are so called because they sit at the edge of the internet. They are also called hosts, and can be further devided into two categories: clients and servers.
2. Access networks are the networks that physically connects an end system to the first router on a path from the end system to any other distant end system, like digital subscribe line(DSL) and cable.
3. The DSL makes use of the telco's existing local telephone infrastructure, they carries both data and traditional telephone signals simultaneously: a high-speed downstream channel; a medium-speed upstream channel; an ordinary two-way telephone channel.
4. The cable internet access the cable television company's existing cable television infrastracture. They require special modem called cable modems.
5. Fiber to the home(FTTH) is another even higher speeds technique which can provide gigabits per second range.
6. A satellite link can be used to connect a residence to the internet at the speed of more than 1 Mbps.
7. Home access networks: DSL、Cable、FTTH、Dial-up、Satellite. Enterprise access: Ethernet and Wifi.
8. Phisycal media fall into two categories: guided media and unguided media. Guided media includes copper wire、cable and fiber. Unguided media includes terrestrial radio channels and satellite  radio channels.
